# AUTO Version Increment

## Summary

Automated version increment PRs for the OpenSearch 3.0.0 release cycle. These are routine maintenance commits generated by the opensearch-trigger-bot to update version numbers in preparation for the next development cycle.

## Details

### What's New in v3.0.0

These PRs represent automated version bumps that occur as part of the standard OpenSearch release process:

- **reporting**: Version incremented to 3.1.0-SNAPSHOT after 3.0.0 release branch cut
- **ml-commons (learning)**: Version management for 3.0 branch

### Technical Changes

#### Version Update Process

The OpenSearch project uses automated tooling to manage version numbers across repositories:

1. When a release branch is cut (e.g., `3.0` branch), the `main` branch is automatically updated to the next SNAPSHOT version
2. The `opensearch-trigger-bot` creates PRs to increment versions
3. These PRs update `build.gradle`, `package.json`, and other version-containing files

#### Files Typically Changed

| File Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `build.gradle` | Gradle build version |
| `package.json` | Node.js package version |
| `opensearch.release` | OpenSearch version properties |

### Impact

No functional changes. These are infrastructure maintenance commits that:

- Prepare the main branch for next release development
- Ensure version consistency across the project
- Enable proper SNAPSHOT builds for development

## Limitations

- These PRs do not introduce new features or bug fixes
- They are part of standard release engineering workflow

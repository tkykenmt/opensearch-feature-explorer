# CVE Fixes & Dependency Updates

## Summary

OpenSearch v3.2.0 includes critical security fixes addressing multiple CVE vulnerabilities across several repositories. These updates patch security issues in third-party dependencies including `commons-beanutils` in ml-commons and `form-data` (via `@cypress/request`) in dashboards-query-workbench.

## Details

### What's New in v3.2.0

This release addresses the following security vulnerabilities:

| CVE | Severity | Repository | Description |
|-----|----------|------------|-------------|
| CVE-2025-48734 | High | ml-commons | Vulnerability in commons-beanutils 1.9.4 |
| CVE-2025-7783 | Critical | dashboards-query-workbench | Unsafe random function in form-data for boundary selection |

### Technical Changes

#### ml-commons: CVE-2025-48734 Fix

The vulnerability exists in `commons-beanutils` version 1.9.4, which is a transitive dependency from `tribuo-clustering-kmeans:4.2.1`. The fix forces the dependency to version 1.11.0.

**Changed Files:**
- `ml-algorithms/build.gradle`: Added explicit dependency on `commons-beanutils:1.11.0`
- `plugin/build.gradle`: Added resolution strategy to force `commons-beanutils:1.11.0`

```gradle
// ml-algorithms/build.gradle
implementation 'commons-beanutils:commons-beanutils:1.11.0'

// plugin/build.gradle
configurations.all {
    resolutionStrategy.force 'commons-beanutils:commons-beanutils:1.11.0'
}
```

#### dashboards-query-workbench: CVE-2025-7783 Fix

CVE-2025-7783 is a critical vulnerability in the `form-data` npm package. The package uses `Math.random()` to select boundary values for multipart form-encoded data. Since `Math.random()` is predictable, an attacker who can observe other random values could predict the boundary and inject malicious parameters.

**Changed Files:**
- `package.json`: Updated `@cypress/request` from `^3.0.0` to `^3.0.9`
- `yarn.lock`: Updated transitive dependencies including `form-data` to 4.0.4

```json
// package.json
{
  "resolutions": {
    "@cypress/request": "^3.0.9"
  }
}
```

The update to `@cypress/request` 3.0.9 brings in `form-data` 4.0.4 which uses cryptographically secure random values for boundary generation.

### Migration Notes

No migration steps required. These are dependency updates that do not change any APIs or configurations.

## Limitations

- The CVE fixes are specific to the affected repositories
- Users running older versions should upgrade to receive these security patches

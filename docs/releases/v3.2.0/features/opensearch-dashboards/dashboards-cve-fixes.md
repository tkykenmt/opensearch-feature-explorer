# Dashboards CVE Fixes

## Summary

OpenSearch Dashboards v3.2.0 addresses CVE-2025-48387, a high-severity vulnerability in the `tar-fs` package. This security fix updates `tar-fs` from versions 2.1.2 and 3.0.8 to patched versions 2.1.3 and 3.1.0 respectively, preventing potential path traversal attacks during tar archive extraction.

## Details

### What's New in v3.2.0

This release fixes a critical security vulnerability that could allow an attacker to write files outside the intended extraction directory when processing specially crafted tar archives.

### Technical Changes

#### Vulnerability Details

| CVE | Package | Severity | CVSS Score | Attack Vector |
|-----|---------|----------|------------|---------------|
| CVE-2025-48387 | tar-fs | High | 7.5 | Network |

The vulnerability affects the `tar-fs` package, which provides filesystem bindings for `tar-stream`. Prior to the fix, a malicious tarball could write files outside the specified extraction directory, potentially leading to arbitrary file overwrites.

#### Dependency Updates

| Package | Previous Version | Fixed Version | Location |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|----------|
| tar-fs | 2.1.2 | 2.1.3 | @osd/opensearch, @osd/test |
| tar-fs | 3.0.8 | 3.1.0 | puppeteer (transitive) |
| puppeteer | 24.4.0 | 24.14.0 | Root package |

    OSD --> PUPPETEER
    OPENSEARCH --> TARFS
    TEST --> TARFS
    PUPPETEER --> TARFS
```

### Migration Notes

No migration steps required. The fix is a transparent dependency update that does not change any APIs or behavior.

## Limitations

- The vulnerability only affects scenarios where untrusted tar archives are extracted
- Development and testing workflows using `@osd/opensearch` and `@osd/test` packages were potentially affected

# Version Increment

## Summary

Automated version increment PRs to bump plugin versions to 3.3.0-SNAPSHOT and 3.3.0.0 across 14 OpenSearch plugin repositories. These PRs are part of the standard release preparation process managed by the `opensearch-trigger-bot`.

## Details

### What's New in v3.3.0

Version increment PRs update the version strings in build configuration files (e.g., `build.gradle`, `gradle.properties`) to prepare plugins for the 3.3.0 release cycle.

### Technical Changes

#### Version Formats
| Format | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `3.3.0-SNAPSHOT` | Development builds during the release cycle |
| `3.3.0.0` | Final release version |

### Automation

These PRs are automatically generated by `opensearch-trigger-bot[bot]` as part of the release workflow. The bot:
1. Creates a branch named `create-pull-request/{version}`
2. Updates version strings in build files
3. Opens a PR targeting the `main` branch
4. Labels the PR with the target version (e.g., `v3.3.0`)

## Limitations

- Version increment PRs are purely mechanical changes
- No functional code changes are included
- PRs require maintainer approval before merge

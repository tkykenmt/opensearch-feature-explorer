# OpenSearch Dashboards CVE Fixes

## Summary

OpenSearch Dashboards v2.16.0 addresses multiple security vulnerabilities (CVEs) by updating vulnerable npm dependencies. These updates fix denial-of-service, prototype pollution, and other security issues in third-party packages.

## Details

### What's New in v2.16.0

Six security-related dependency updates were merged to address known CVEs:

| CVE/Advisory | Package | Previous Version | Updated Version | Severity |
|--------------|---------|------------------|-----------------|----------|
| CVE-2024-28863 | tar | 6.1.13 | 6.2.1 | High |
| CVE-2024-33883 | ejs | 3.1.7 | 3.1.10 | High |
| CVE-2024-4067, CVE-2024-4068 | braces (via micromatch, webpack) | < 3.0.3 | 3.0.3+ | High |
| GHSA-x565-32qp-m3vf | jimp (phin dependency) | < 0.22.0 | 0.22.0 | Medium |
| SNYK-JS-AXIOS-6144788 | axios | < 1.7.2 | 1.7.2 | Medium |
| CVE-2024-37890 | ws | 8.5.0, 7.5.7 | 8.17.1, 7.5.10 | High |

### Technical Changes

#### tar (CVE-2024-28863)
Denial of service vulnerability in the tar package. The update to 6.2.1 fixes the issue where specially crafted tar files could cause excessive CPU consumption.

#### ejs (CVE-2024-33883)
Template injection vulnerability in the EJS templating engine. The update to 3.1.10 addresses prototype pollution issues.

#### braces (CVE-2024-4067, CVE-2024-4068)
Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability in the braces package. Multiple packages were updated:
- `@amoo-miki/webpack` to `4.46.0-xxhash.1`
- `micromatch` to `4.0.7`
- `@types/watchpack` to `2.4.4`
- `watchpack` to `2.4.1`

#### jimp (GHSA-x565-32qp-m3vf)
The `phin` HTTP client dependency had a vulnerability. The update to `jimp@0.22.0` removes the vulnerable code path, and an arbitrary bump of `phin` avoids including the offending version in dev dependencies.

#### axios (SNYK-JS-AXIOS-6144788)
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in axios. The update to 1.7.2 fixes the issue.

#### ws (CVE-2024-37890)
Denial of service vulnerability in the WebSocket library. Both major version lines were updated:
- ws 8.x: 8.5.0 → 8.17.1
- ws 7.x: 7.5.7 → 7.5.10

## Limitations

- These are dependency updates only; no functional changes to OpenSearch Dashboards
- Users running older versions should upgrade to receive these security fixes

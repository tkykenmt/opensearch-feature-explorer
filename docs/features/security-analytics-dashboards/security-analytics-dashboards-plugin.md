# Security Analytics Dashboards Plugin

## Summary

The Security Analytics Dashboards plugin provides the user interface for OpenSearch Security Analytics, enabling security teams to detect threats, investigate security events, and manage detection rules through OpenSearch Dashboards. It integrates with the Security Analytics backend plugin to provide visualization of findings, alerts, correlations, and threat intelligence data.

### Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Detectors | Create and manage threat detectors with detection rules |
| Findings | View and investigate security findings generated by detectors |
| Alerts | Configure and manage alerts based on findings |
| Correlations | Visualize relationships between security events |
| Rules | Import, create, and customize Sigma detection rules |
| Threat Intel | Manage threat intelligence sources and IOCs |
| Log Types | Configure log type mappings for detection |

### Key Features

- **Detector Management**: Create detectors with custom rules and field mappings
- **Findings Dashboard**: View, filter, and investigate security findings
- **Alert Configuration**: Set up notifications for security events
- **Correlation Graph**: Visualize relationships between correlated findings
- **Rule Editor**: Create and customize Sigma-based detection rules
- **Threat Intelligence**: Integrate external threat feeds and IOC sources
- **Multi-Data Source Support**: Work with multiple OpenSearch data sources

### Configuration

The plugin integrates with OpenSearch Dashboards and requires the Security Analytics backend plugin.

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `securityAnalytics.enabled` | Enable/disable the plugin | `true` |

## Limitations

- Requires Security Analytics backend plugin to be installed
- Some features require specific OpenSearch Dashboards versions for full compatibility

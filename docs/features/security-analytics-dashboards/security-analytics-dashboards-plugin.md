# Security Analytics Dashboards Plugin

## Summary

The Security Analytics Dashboards plugin provides the user interface for OpenSearch Security Analytics, enabling security teams to detect threats, investigate security events, and manage detection rules through OpenSearch Dashboards. It integrates with the Security Analytics backend plugin to provide visualization of findings, alerts, correlations, and threat intelligence data.
